Two-Stage Semantic Segmentation

Published work combining superpixel segmentation (SEEDS) and a custom deep net architecture (Fork Net) for semantic segmentation on Pascal VOC.

Key Contributions:
Efficient semantic segmentation using superpixels
Dual-input ForkNet architecture for context-aware labeling
Achieved competitive mIoU vs FCN, DeepLabv2, and PSPNet
Tools: OpenCV (C++), Keras (Python), TensorFlow, Pascal VOC dataset
