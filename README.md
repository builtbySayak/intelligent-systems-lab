# Intelligent Systems Lab #

Welcome to my personal R&D repository showcasing intelligent systems I've worked on across **Natural Language Processing**, **Computer Vision** and **Software Engineering** domains.
This repository includes original research, course-based implementations and practical machine learning pipelines. Some project components are kept private due to co-authorship or institutional collaboration policies.



## Project Highlights

### NLP
- **Sentiment Analysis**: SVM vs Logistic Regression on Amazon reviews using TF-IDF, class balancing.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Modified Pointer-Generator network with novelty loss for better abstraction.  
   [arXiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10959)
- **Mental Health Classifier**  
  Detects emotional distress in Reddit posts using TF-IDF, XGBoost, RoBERTa, and a Stacked Ensemble.  
  Includes web deployment with Streamlit for real-time text classification.  


### CV
- **Cartoon vs Sketch Classification**: CNN + ML comparison on IIIT-CFW dataset.  
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Published method using SEEDS + ForkNet for superpixel-aware segmentation.
