# Intelligent Systems Lab #

Welcome to my personal R&D repository showcasing intelligent systems I've worked on across **Natural Language Processing**, **Computer Vision** and **Software Engineering** domains.
This repository includes original research, course-based implementations and practical machine learning pipelines. Some project components are kept private due to co-authorship or institutional collaboration policies.



## 🔍 Project Highlights

### NLP
- **Sentiment Analysis**: SVM vs Logistic Regression on Amazon reviews using TF-IDF, class balancing.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Modified Pointer-Generator network with novelty loss for better abstraction.  
  🔗 [arXiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10959)

### CV
- **Cartoon vs Sketch Classification**: CNN + ML comparison on IIIT-CFW dataset.  
- **Semantic Segmentation**: Published method using SEEDS + ForkNet for superpixel-aware segmentation.  
  🔗 [Conference Paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338685909_Two_Stage_Semantic_Segmentation_by_SEEDS_and_Fork_Net)

### SDE
- Backend development with `FastAPI`, `Docker`, and `PostgreSQL`
- Custom ML service APIs and university admission prediction pipelines  
- Some source code and deployment configs are internal and not publicly shared


## Technologies Used

'Python', 'PyTorch', 'Keras', 'OpenCV', 'Scikit-learn', 'TensorFlow', 'FastAPI', 'Docker', 'PostgreSQL', 'Git', 'Jupyter'


## Disclaimer

Some projects or code files are partially shared or redacted due to:
